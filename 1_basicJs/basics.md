## What is programming:
> Programming: 
>
> Speaking a digital language. Allowing for the communication with digital devicess. Program a robot on Mars, Software to communicate with mission control, animations and applications on the web, VR, and so much more. The communication comes in the form of a list of instructions which we call our program.



## What is a statement:
> Statement:
> The list of intructions to communicate with digital machines are called a statements.
> ```javascript

> if ( a > b) {

## Branching Adding Logic & Code Blocks
If you have only been introduced to HTML and CSS you have not yet seen the power of a programming language.

Programs allow us to create logic, or have our computer make choices for is. We can say if this condition is true do this block of code. Otherwise skip that code and move on to the next piece of logic.

### If Statement

The if statement is a basic branching statement. The if takes a boolean expression as an argument. If the expression is true, the code in the code block gets exectued otherwise move on to the next line. If statements can be mixed with else and else/if statements
